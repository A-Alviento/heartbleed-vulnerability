# heartbleed-vulnerability

This repository is a simple implementation of the heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL, coded in python. A simplified handshake protocol is also implemented to simulate the start of a connection between a client and a server. 
Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange algorithm was used to generate the shared key, which was then used for the 128-bit AES to encrypt all subsequent transmissions.

## Getting Started

#### Navigate Project

- `client.ipynb` and `server.ipynb` are the notebooks implementing the simulated client and server. These notebooks are used to demonstrate the heartbleed vulnerability.
- `aes.py` is a script containing the required functions to implement a simple 128-bit AES encryption algorithm.
- `SSLPacket.py` contains the class for the SSL packets used by the client and server to transmit to each other.

More in-depth details will be found in the client and server notebooks.

#### Installations

- See `requirements.txt`
- Tested on `python=3.8`

#### Run

- Clone this repo and navigate to `client.ipynb` and `server.ipynb`.
- Read the markdown cells for detailed description of the project.
- To run the demo, run all the cells in `server.ipynb` to start the server.
- Then, run all the cells in `client.ipynb` to initialise the handshake protocol from the client side, and the heartbleed exploit will subsequently be run as well.
