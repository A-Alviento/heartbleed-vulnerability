    "- Subject name (entity which certificate is issued to)\n",
    "- Digital signature of the issuer (entity which issued the certificate) --> Signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)'s private key which can be verified by anyone using CA's public key, proving that the certificate is authentic and CA vouches for the entity presenting the certificate.\n",
